As a Command-line Interface (CLI) app, you'll never have to move your hands away from the keyboard to get all your tasks done.
If you can type fast, the CLI will allow you to execute your tasks quickly. While this may be daunting for a new user, it only takes a short time to get accustomed to CinnamonBun.

This guide aims to be the one-stop shop to get you from noob to expert in record speed.

## Commands

### Command Syntax

Commands in CinnamonBun can be broken down into several components.

`COMMAND_WORD PREAMBLE PREFIX/ARGUMENT...`

| Component      | Description                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `COMMAND_WORD` | Trigger for the command to be executed.                                                                                              |
 | `PREAMBLE`     | Text before the first valid parameter prefix in the command. Certain commands may require a preamble.                                | 
| `PREFIX`       | Commands may have one more or arguments. The prefix specifies which arguments to map to the parameters. All prefixes end with a `/`. |
 | `ARGUMENT`     | The argument to pass to the command.                                                                                                 |

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-primary">:bangbang: **Attention**

* Commands and their arguments are case-sensitive
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### User Guide Syntax

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the arguments to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an argument which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family t/colleague` etc.

### Fields & Tags

A client can have many fields & tags, including both optional and compulsory ones.

| Field    | Prefix   | Constraints                                                                                                                                | Compulsory         | Example                                   |

  the client whose birthday field is empty, will be sorted to the bottom of the other clients named 'Alice'.

</div>

Examples:
* `sort n/ desc p/`: Clients will be sorted in descending order of their name. Clients with the same name will be then sorted 
based on their phone numbers in ascending order.

based on their addresses in ascending order.

## Special Features

### Command Chains

Multiple commands can be chained by separating each command with the `|` character.
Each command is run sequentially from first to last.
Invalid commands and special commands `help` and `exit` will break the chain and stop further command execution.  

e.g `add n/John Doe e/johndoe@email.com | edit 5 p/999 | delete 2`

### Command History

You can navigate through your command history by using the up and down arrow keys.
The command history works similarly to the Linux bash terminal.

### Clickable Client Card

You can list all transactions of a client by clicking the client's card.
This is equivalent to typing `findTransaction INDEX` in the command box.

### Themes

You can change between the light or dark theme by click on the menu bar and selecting `Theme > Cinnamon` or `Theme > Caramel`.
